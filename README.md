# 🔥 Climformatics – Heat-Related Hospitalization Forecast

This is an interactive Streamlit app that predicts **heat-related hospitalization spikes** using weather and environmental indicators. It supports **interpretability** through SHAP explanations and **natural language summaries** generated by GPT.

## 🧩 Features
- Interactive sliders for weather variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, solar radiation)
- County-level prediction of spike events
- SHAP-based waterfall visualization to explain model output
- GPT-4o-generated narrative explanations tailored for different user types:
  - **General public**
  - **Policymakers**
  - **Scientific experts**

## 🧪 Model Summary
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Classifier within a Scikit-Learn Pipeline
- **Target**: 3-day rolling max of hospitalization spikes (shifted 2 days ahead)
- **Validation**: Walk-forward cross-validation (5 folds)
- **Features**: Z-scored lagged and aggregated weather variables (e.g., temperature, wet-bulb, radiation)
